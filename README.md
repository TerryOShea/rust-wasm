Playing around with Rust + WASM. Clone and run `yarn everything`.

Based on [this tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/rust-react-and-web-assembly/) (although some things are out of date there). I'll also be checking out [this book](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/introduction.html) soon.
